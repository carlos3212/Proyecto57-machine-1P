Objectification Theory and the Family: The Effect of Attachment Insecurity on Self-Objectification and Attentional Bias toward Eating Disorder Stimuli,"Russon, Jody Moser",Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives,Couples Therapy,Couples Therapy,"Eating disorders (EDs) and disordered eating represent a serious public health issue among young adolescent and adult populations. EDs are predominately a problem for girls and women. Approximately 90% of people who develop EDs are female (Harvard Health Publications, 2012). Objectification theory (Frederickson & Roberts, 1997) posits that internalization of sexualized media messages (self-objectification) and social pressures lead to ED behaviors. Not all females exposed to objectifying stimuli experience ED behaviors. This study explored insecurity in family relationships as a risk factor; specifically, whether women who have greater attachment insecurity are more prone to self-objectification and ED-specific attentional bias. Components of Frederickson et al.'s (1998) and Tiggemann & Boundy’s (2008) experimental designs were replicated. This design has shown that (1) self-objectification can be heightened by context, and (2) self-objectification induces feelings of body shame, which promote ED behaviors. To test attachment insecurity as a risk factor in the objectification framework, a repeated measures experimental design was conducted with women (n = 107), between the ages of 18 and 35. This study utilized a repeated measures, experimental design where each participant either viewed an image set reinforcing the thin-ideal or a control image set of products (no people). Participants were assigned to one of four groups using the minimization method (high attachment insecurity and control images; low attachment insecurity and control images; high attachment insecurity and experimental images; low attachment insecurity and experimental images). Groups were balanced on race, type of insecurity (anxious, avoidant, both), and level of insecurity (over a standard deviation above the mean). The study involved deception in that participants were told that the purpose was to understand women’s attitudes towards advertising. Participants took a screening measure online to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria and then were invited to an in-person session. During in-person data-collection sessions, participants filled out outcome-specific, exploratory and deception self-report measures, viewed the experimental or control image set, and took a cognitive processing test with ED-specific stimuli. Using a factorial MANCOVA, the following hypotheses were tested while controlling for self-esteem (SISE) and parental psychological control (PCS-YSR): 1) Exposure to objectifying stimuli will cause higher levels of state self-objectification (TST) and greater attentional bias towards ED-salient stimuli (ED-specific stroop test); and 2) Exposure to objectifying stimuli will cause higher levels of state self-objectification and greater attentional bias towards ED-salient stimuli for the high attachment insecurity (ECR-RS) group. These hypotheses were tested within a sample of racially and ethnically diverse women. Results demonstrated that those in the high attachment insecurity group demonstrated more attentional bias towards ED-specific stimuli regardless of condition. Implications for family therapists and research limitations are discussed.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201"
Facilitators and Barriers to Healthy Eating and Disease Management Among Low-Income Seniors Residing in Subsidized Housing: A Case Study,"Petroka, Katherine Frances",Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives,Nutritional Physiological Phenomena,Nutritional Physiological Phenomena,"Low-income seniors residing in subsidized housing may develop unhealthy eating behaviors and experience poor health outcomes due to a lack of access to fresh produce in their local environment. Guild House West (GHW) is a Quaker-run subsidized housing facility for seniors and disabled individuals located in the West Poplar neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. GHW was established and is managed by Friends Rehabilitation Program, a Quaker-related non-profit, whose mission is to provide affordable housing and social services for seniors, low-income persons, and individuals with special needs. GHW is located in a neighborhood with low access to supermarkets but has the unique feature of a community garden implemented by the nonprofit organization Greener Partners. There is also a food pantry on site offering packaged goods to the residents once a week. Community-based participatory research was incorporated to establish a community partnership between Drexel University's Nutrition Sciences  Department, Greener Partners, and GHW. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to incorporate formative research methods to gain a better understanding of the nutrition-related needs of the population living in a subsidized housing facility for future research. The researcher determined if community-driven nutrition education programing could be implemented to facilitate improvements in dietary intake and self-management of nutrition-related chronic conditions among low-income seniors. This manuscript describes the preliminary stage of the formative research process, as the researcher collected information using ethnographic and phenomenological approaches to help inform the rest of the research process. Following 12 months of interacting directly with the GHW population, common themes and behaviors were identified. The two aspects of the case study focus on themes seen in 1) food focus groups during cooking classes 2) food pantry use and barriers to access. Focus group questions were developed and residents were invited in-person and through a weekly newsletter to participate in food focus groups by GHW management and the researcher. Participation in the GHW community food pantry was pursued initially to better understand the needs of the residents for future research/programming. A thematic analysis was performed using NVivo 10, a software package that is used to organize and manage qualitative databases. Generalizable information was gathered on the beliefs and behaviors of the GHW residents. Seven major themes and sub-themes were derived from the NVivo 10 Software data analysis of the attitudes and behaviors of the residents at GHW during food focus groups and food pantry participation. Themes included negative dietary attitudes about diet quality, challenges of change around nutrition and healthy eating, external barriers in the food environment, negative influences in the internal environment, disconnect between disease state and nutrition recommendations, difficulties of disease self-management through dietary modifications, and interest for learning new recipes to improve nutrition knowledge base. The significance of understanding the attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs surrounding the internal and external challenges to healthful eating were classified in this case study. Acknowledging the impact that barriers had on the social and personal constructs of low-income seniors residing in subsidized housing was found to be a successful strategy in informing the research process for future nutrition programming. The themes are considered generalizable to similar populations indicating that community-driven nutrition education programming can be implemented within a subsidized living setting to facilitate improvements in dietary intake and self-management of disease among low-income seniors. This research uncovered two novel concepts; residents were not familiar with healthier food options that were not culturally relevant and community tensions existed among the residents due to lack of social cohesion. Future research must consider these novel concepts while developing nutrition programming within subsidized housing facilities.M.S., Human Nutrition -- Drexel University, 201"
Examining Disparities in Breast Cancer Screening Rates in a Program Designed to Provide Free Care to Women in the State of Pennsylvania,"Mohamad Baba, Zeinab",Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives,Public Health,Public Health,"Background. Female breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in women (behind lung cancer) (U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group, 2013b). The purpose of this research was to examine client and provider level characteristics driving the disparities in morbidity and mortality as it relates to breast cancer screening, thus providing a clear indication of what client and provider factors are essential for successfully reducing disparities in breast cancer screening beyond removing barriers of cost. Specific aims include: (1) To characterize the client population utilizing the services of the Healthy Woman Program in Pennsylvania; (2) To Identify client and provider predictive factors that influence women with an initial screening mammogram to return for rescreening within 24 months; and (3) To use a local case study to explore service delivery factors influencing woman with an initial screening mammogram to return for rescreening. Methods. This study was a retrospective analysis of prospective data from the Healthy Woman Program (HWP), investigating women enrolled in the HWP in Pennsylvania and their rescreening rates. As the HWP dataset primarily contained client-level variables, additional structural provider-level variables were derived from Komen Foundation data, and data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Census, to extend the investigation beyond the individual woman to specified contextual effects. A local qualitative case study augmented the quantitative analysis to explore more process-oriented contextual effects, with an emphasis on how services are organized to support client outreach and retention, and promising practices for getting clients to return for rescreening. Results. The major predictors of an abnormal mammogram were having a diagnostic mammogram rather than a screening mammogram, being younger than 40, and living in an urban area. The major predictors of a breast cancer diagnosis were being white, being younger than 40, living in a large rural town, and being a current smoker. The major predictors of dropping out after an abnormal mammogram were being white, and having a diagnostic mammogram rather than a screening mammogram. The major predictors of delay in diagnostic work up were Black race and screening mammogram. The major predictors of returning for screening were living in a large rural town, being a non-smoker, having no symptoms prior to the initial mammogram, having a normal result from the initial mammogram, and living with others. Comprehensive breast cancer education, delivered in community settings, and tailored to cultural, social, and literacy issues, results in a robust referral network. More reminders than mandated by HWP Guidance, through multiple channels, rather than the client alone, increase returns for annual rescreening. Conclusions. Prior investigation of rescreening rates among low-income women has focused on client-level factors, yielding a narrow range of targets for systems change. This study investigated both client and provider level characteristics, analyzing them together and separately, to increase understanding of the multifactorial predictors of rescreening and widen the set of potential targets for change. Instituting a protocol of allowing community groups to organize a few women to have screenings in one day and allowing for interpreters who are family or community members would improve rescreening rates. Methods for ensuring patients return should be modified as the HWP sequence may not be enough.Dr.P.H., Public Health -- Drexel University, 201"
What are the unique obstacles Black theater experiences in the 21st century and how can they can create a symbiotic relationship with their communities for the potential sustainability of both?,"Ford, Tanesha M.",Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives,"Arts Management, Black theater, Racism, Regional economic disparities, Political participation","Arts Management, Black theater, Racism, Regional economic disparities, Political participation","The question set forth in this thesis is, “What are the unique obstacles Black theater experiences in the 21st century and how can they can create a symbiotic relationship with their communities for the potential sustainability of both?” Its purpose is to investigate the root challenges Black theater experiences in achieving sustainability in America, to discern how much American racial turmoil has affected the Black community and therefore Black theater, and to identify methods by which Black theater can reverse engineer a path to a symbiotic relationship with their communities in order to consistently achieve the sustainability of both. This thesis found that Black theaters in America are far less represented than their Eurocentric counterparts. Black theaters memberships within theater industry trade organizations (i.e., League of Resident Theaters and Theater Communications Group) are not reflective of the number of Black theaters operating in America. Black theaters represent approximately 13% of theater community, but less than 2% have memberships in industry groups. Black theaters are also disproportionally less visible than their Eurocentric counterparts. In this era of almost immediate digital access, accessing the existence of or information on theaters for and by the African American Diaspora is nominal at best. The national databases researched for this thesis; League of Resident Theatres, Theater Communications Group, Actors Equity and others, do not either have Black theaters listed within them, or do not signify the existence a theater as a Black theater. Nor is there any empirical data specifically on why this disparity exists in the theater community. However, this thesis found a correlation between the success or failure of the Black communities compared to the success or failure of Eurocentric communities and the success or failure of Black theaters compared to Eurocentric theaters. This disparity of representation of Black theater is a reflection of racial inequality in American culture. When identifying challenges in the Black community I found that systemic racism leads to economic inequality (African American household income in America consistently less than Eurocentric household incomes Figure 6 Figure 7, which ultimately leads to failing communities Figure 4. This same paradigm occurs in Black theater yet manifests slightly differently: Systemic racism leads to economic inequality (individual donor priorities shift to need base reasoning, audience participation from the community dissipates from, in part, lack of funding) which leads to failing communities (Black theaters struggle to earn income through ticket sales and/or programming as their primary constituent suffers). This thesis recommends that Black theaters return to community engagement rather than audience engagement. Engaging into the community, being an integral part of the the functionality of the community, not only can Black theater be able to develop a stable business model but in turn be a catalyst for the sustainability within the community. Recommendations include: (1) Changing the narrative to achieving stability versus success, (1a) Contributed income, mission and vision, and achieving a healthy longevity are how Black theaters can achieve sustainability, (1b) Black theater needs to be mobile, innovative, inclusive and civic minded in order to survive in today’s techno-distracted society, (2) Choose “Community Engagement”. The act of taking a group of people from the same place, purpose, goals or interests, and presenting material that reflects that place, purposes, goals or interests to maintain their attention and interest for a certain amount of time, (3) Civic Engagement using the resources readily available within the arts community designed specifically for the communities Black theater serves, ( i.e. creative placemaking) to further strengthen the organization and in turn the community it serves.M.S., Arts Administration -- Drexel University, 201"
A Preliminary Investigation of a Personalized Risk Alert System for Weight Control Lapses,"Goldstein, Stephanie Paige",Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives,"Psychology, Reducing diets, Weight Loss","Psychology, Reducing diets, Weight Loss","Failures to adhere to dietary recommendations in a weight loss program have been attributed to the notion that short-term violations of behavioral “rules” (e.g., dietary lapses) can often precipitate a return to prior behavior patterns. Existing studies suggest that lapses are caused by a select group of internal and external cues, indicating that they may be predictable. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) can utilize mathematical models to learn the way in which triggers predict lapse behavior, and then communicate this knowledge to the individual in the form of momentary alerts to risk. The primary aim of the current study was to develop an initial machine learning model (accuracy > 70%, sensitivity > 70%, and specificity > 50%) capable of predicting lapse behavior in a sample of overweight and obese participants following a standardized weight control diet. Users (n = 12, MBMI = 33.6) were prompted to report on lapses and relevant triggers six quasi-random times per day via personal smartphone for six weeks. Participants reported an average of 3.47 lapses per week (SD = 2.41) and completed an average of 94.64% of prompts. This data was used to build a classification model (using C4.5 WEKA decision trees) to predict dietary lapses. The final model accuracy (.72) met our standards for success while maintaining good sensitivity (.70) and specificity (.72). Significance testing revealed this model predicted lapses better than random chance (p < .01). Further analyses related to data collection procedures, variable selection, and individual-level models are presented below. Results from this project indicate that machine learning holds promise for the real-time prediction of dietary lapse, and the algorithm from this project will be utilized in a JITAI application framework to predict and prevent lapses.M.S., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201"
Financial capacity and neuropsychological performance in acquired brain injury (ABI),"Sunderaraman, Preeti",Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives,Clinical Psychology.,Clinical Psychology.,"Difficulty with financial capacity (i.e., difficulty with efficiently managing one's finances), a common consequence in individuals with moderate to severe brain injury, has been found to affect self-autonomy and limit the individual from fully integrating into the community. Previous studies have found that individuals with brain injury have impaired financial capacity six months post-injury. However, the nature of financial capacity with post-injury periods extending to more than a year has not been studied. Moreover, there is mixed evidence regarding the nature and extent to which different cognitive abilities contribute to financial capacity. Therefore, the current study had three specific aims: (1) To compare the nature of financial capacity in individuals with chronic, moderate to severe acquired brain injury (ABI) with demographically matched controls. (2) To examine the contributions of various cognitive abilities (attention, working memory, executive functions, impulsivity) to financial capacity in the ABI group. (3) To investigate the association between the self-report and informant-report report of financial capacity, in the ABI group. A total of 25 participants with chronic, moderate to severe ABI were recruited from a day-treatment program, and 9 age and education matched-healthy control participants were recruited from the community. All participants were administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to measure cognitive abilities and the Financial Competence Assessment Inventory (FCAI) to assess financial capacity. In addition, 22 informants were interviewed using the Third Party Perspective FCAI. Results indicated that the control group outperformed the ABI group on the overall and the different dimensions of financial capacity. In the ABI group, specific cognitive abilities, including attention, working memory, delayed verbal memory, abstract reasoning and impulsivity contributed to different dimensions of financial capacity. However, no associations were found between ABI- and informant-reports of financial capacity suggesting the confounding presence of a combination of cognitive impairments and biases. These findings shed light on the compromised nature of financial management in ABI individuals years after a brain injury, and underscore the importance of focusing on continued monitoring and rehabilitation of this crucial functional ability.Ph.D., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201"
The Relational Effects of Mindfulness Training: A Phenomenological Study,"Gillespie, Bob",Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives,"Family Therapy, Marital Therapy, Mindfulness, Couples Therapy","Family Therapy, Marital Therapy, Mindfulness, Couples Therapy","Using General Systems Theory (Bertalanffy, 1968) and Phenomenology (Husserl, 1913/1931), this qualitative phenomenological study examined the relational effects of mindfulness training when one partner completed an 8-week, hospital based Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR, Kabat-Zinn, 1990) within the last 6 months. In a sample of 12 couples, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with: a) recent MBSR graduates, b) their intimate partners, and c) both members of the couple together. The recent MBSR graduates were novel meditators who had limited previous mindfulness experience before taking the MBSR training and included 7 female and 6 male MBSR graduates. Ten heterosexual couples and 2 same sex couples participated in the study, and the average relationship length was 14.5 years. Over 95% of the participants were White, and 62.5% had graduate degrees. Before the interviews, all couples completed the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Busby et al., 1995), which indicated that 6 out of 12 couples were relationally distressed. A modified version of the interpretative phenomenological analysis method (Smith et al., 2009) informed the data analysis. The following major themes emerged for the MBSR graduates: 1) awareness of emotional reactivity; 2) creating space and time; 3) making different choices; and 4) humility and moments of connection. Findings confirmed that self-awareness and emotional regulation are not only major outcomes of mindfulness training, but could also be pathways to relationship growth. The intensity and reactivity of intimate partner relationships can offer both opportunities and challenges for MBSR participants trying to integrate mindfulness into their daily lives. Although intimate partners observed improved emotional balance in the graduates, their descriptions of the benefits of MBSR training were diluted compared to the graduates' descriptions. The intimate partners revealed that behavioral shifts in the graduates were emerging, but were limited in scale--suggesting that individual outcomes of MBSR training do not automatically transfer to relationship outcomes. Developing more mindfulness-enhanced couple interventions that prioritize conjoint participation and emphasize relational outcomes may harness the potential relational benefits of mindfulness practice. Future research should focus on the potential differences between distressed and non-distressed couples and include more diverse samples of couples.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201"
